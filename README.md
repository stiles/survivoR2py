# survivoR2py: Survivor data for Python users

## About

The code in this repository converts data files in an R package devoted to the Survivor television series from `.rda` to `.csv` and `.json` formats for users who prefer Python or other data sceience tools. 

## Sources

The data comes from the canonical [survivoR](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR) package created by [David Ohm](https://github.com/doehm), et al, which contains detailed datasets about the history of the show, including an episode summary, castaway listing, challenge results and vote history, among many others. 

## Process

### Convert survivoR data

- `scripts/convert_data.py`: This script converts the survivoR data by fetching the latest `.rda` files from the source, storing copies locally in `data/raw/rda`, and then converting them to comma-delimited text files in `data/processed/csv`. A Gihub Actions workflow also runs the script once daily at 8 pm Pacific Time to keep the files fresh during a season, storing data in the repo and also on S3.

*Notes: The converted `.rda` data files from the [original project](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/blob/master/README.md) are stored in this repo's `raw/csv` directory. The content of those files <ins>won't change</ins> â€” only the file formats. Any value errors can be flagged as issues there. They are typically resolved quickly. Also: Please see the [original repo](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/blob/master/README.md) for metadata about the individual files.*
